            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>Web developers create and maintain websites. They are also responsible for the site's technical aspects,
                such as its performance and capacity, which are measures of a website's speed and how much traffic the
                site can handle. In addition, web developers may create content for the site.</p>
